# Introduction to the research letter
2015 witnessed the first annual decrease in life expectancy in the US since 1993. While life expectancy decreased for both whites and blacks, black men fared the worst, losing nearly twice as many years of life expectancy as white men. It was also observed that the infant mortality rate increased for blacks while decreasing for whites between 2014 and 2015. We investigated trends in infant deaths from specific causes for blacks and whites over the past ten years in the US, and report if any specific causes of death increased concomitantly with the recent increase in infant mortality among blacks.
