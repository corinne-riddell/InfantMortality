**Introduction**

2015 witnessed the first annual decrease in life expectancy in the US since 1993.<sup>1</sup> While life expectancy decreased for both whites and blacks, black men fared the worst, losing nearly twice as many years of life expectancy as white men.<sup>2</sup> It was also observed that the infant mortality rate increased for blacks while decreasing for whites between 2014 and 2015. We investigated trends in infant deaths from specific causes for blacks and whites over the past ten years in the US, and report if any specific causes of death increased concomitantly with the recent increase in infant mortality among blacks.

**Methods**

We abstracted data on deaths and population for Non-Hispanic black and white infants from the US National Vital Statistics System by cause of infant death for 2005-2015.<sup>3</sup> The infant mortality rate was calculated as the number of deaths divided by the population size, according to race, year, and cause of death. We calculated rates for the top four causes of infant death and for a residual category encapsulating all other causes. The excess event rate among blacks was calculated as the absolute difference between the rates. We do not include confidence intervals because all deaths are included and therefore are not subject to sampling error.<sup>4</sup> R version 3.2.4 was used to conduct this analysis. No ethical review was required since this study used de-identified data.

**Results**

From 2005 to 2012, the infant mortality rate for Non-Hispanic blacks decreased from 14.3 to 11.1 per 1,000 infants (**Figure 1a**). Thereafter, the infant mortality rate in blacks plateaued, and increased from 11.0 to 11.2 per 1,000 from 2014 to 2015. For Non-Hispanic whites, the rate decreased monotonically from 5.9 to 4.9 per 1,000 from 2005 to 2015. Because the black infant mortality rate declined faster than the white rate, excess events in blacks fell from 8.4 deaths per 1,000 infants in 2005 to 6.0 deaths per 1,000 in 2012, but rose to 6.3 in 2015 (**Figure 1b**). These excess events imply nearly 4000 additional infant deaths among the 614972 blacks infants compared to the number of deaths that would have occurred had they experienced the mortality rate among whites.

**Figure 2** shows trends in cause-specific mortality for the four leading causes of infant death and all other causes. Between 2005 and 2011, deaths from short gestation and low birthweight decreased for blacks, but have plateaued in recent years. For other leading causes, rates among blacks and whites decreased between 2005 and 2015, although deaths related to both Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and congenital malformations increased for blacks last year. Progress has stalled with respect to all other causes of infant death in recent years, and last year also saw an increase for blacks, but not for whites.

**Comment**

The sustained progress in reducing infant mortality among blacks since 2005 stalled in the past few years, leading to increases in the absolute inequality in infant mortality between blacks and whites in two of the past three years. No single cause appears solely responsible for the recent increase in black infant mortality. The preterm birth rate is nearly 50% higher for blacks compared with whites,<sup>5</sup> and black infants experience three times as many deaths related to short gestation/low birthweight, making it the leading cause of infant death among blacks. Interventions to further reduce the rate of preterm birth among blacks appear the most promising option for reducing black infant mortality, and the absolute inequality between black and white infants.

To confirm our findings, linked birth/death files should be used once they become available for the most recent years.
