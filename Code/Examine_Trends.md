**Introduction**

The infant mortality rate is an important indicator of population health. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the US infant mortality rate decreased by 15% in the past decade.<sup>1</sup> The objective of this research letter is to establish if both blacks and whites benefitted equally from this decrease. We investigated recent trends in the absolute difference in the overall and cause-specific infant mortality rates between non-Hispanic black and whites.

**Methods**

We abstracted data on live births and deaths in the first year of life for Non-Hispanic black and white infants from the US National Vital Statistics System for 2005-2015. The infant mortality rate was calculated as the number of deaths (mortality file)<sup>2</sup> divided by the number of births (natality file)<sup>3</sup>, according to race-ethnicity, year, and cause of death. We calculated rates for the top four causes of infant death and for a residual category encapsulating all other causes. The excess event rate among blacks was calculated as the absolute difference between the rates. We do not include confidence intervals because all deaths are included and therefore are not subject to sampling error.<sup>4</sup> R version 3.2.4 was used to conduct the analysis. No ethical review was required since this study used de-identified data. A replication data set including the raw data and statistical code to reproduce the letter is publicly available on github: <https://github.com/corinne-riddell/InfantMortality/>.

**Results**

From 2005 to 2012, the infant mortality rate for Non-Hispanic blacks decreased from 14.3 to 11.6 per 1,000 births (**Figure 1a**). Thereafter, the infant mortality rate in blacks plateaued, and increased from 11.4 to 11.7 per 1,000 from 2014 to 2015. For Non-Hispanic whites, the rate decreased monotonically from 5.7 to 4.8 per 1,000 from 2005 to 2015. Because the black infant mortality rate declined faster than the white rate, excess events in blacks fell from 8.6 deaths per 1,000 births in 2005 to 6.6 deaths per 1,000 in 2012, but rose to 6.9 in 2015 (**Figure 1b**). These excess events imply over 4000 additional infant deaths among the 589047 blacks births compared to the number of expected deaths if they had experienced the same mortality rate as whites.

**Figure 2** shows trends in cause-specific mortality for the four leading causes of infant death and all other causes. Between 2005 and 2011, deaths from short gestation and low birthweight decreased for blacks, but have plateaued in recent years. For other leading causes (Congenital malformations, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and maternal complications), rates among blacks and whites decreased between 2005 and 2015, although deaths related to both SIDS and congenital malformations increased for blacks last year. Progress has stalled with respect to all other causes of infant death in recent years, and last year also saw a relatively larger increase for blacks compared with whites.

**Comment**

The sustained progress in reducing infant mortality among blacks since 2005 stalled in the past few years, leading to increases in the absolute inequality in infant mortality between blacks and whites in two of the past three years. No single cause appears solely responsible for the recent increase in black infant mortality, and some arbitrariness likely exists in assigning a single underlying cause for many infants. The preterm birth rate is nearly 50% higher for blacks compared with whites,<sup>5</sup> and black infants experience nearly four times as many deaths related to short gestation/low birthweight, making it the leading cause of infant death among blacks. Interventions to further reduce the rate of preterm birth among blacks appear the most promising option for reducing black infant mortality, and the absolute inequality between black and white infants.
